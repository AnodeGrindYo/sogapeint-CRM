Backgrounds          Use background utility classes to            change the appearance of individual progress bars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Labels Example          Add labels to your progress bars by placing text within the .progress-bar.                                                                              Multiple bars          Include multiple progress bars in a progress component if you need.                                                                                                                                        Height          We only set a height value on the .progress-bar, so if you change            that value the outer .progress            will automatically resize accordingly.                                                                                                                                               Animated stripes          The striped gradient can also be            animated. Add .progress-bar-animated to .progress-bar to animate the            stripes right to left via CSS3 animations.                                                                                    Striped          Add .progress-bar-striped            to any .progress-bar to apply a            stripe via CSS gradient over the progress bar’s background color.
